If this is a function, it is                                           assumed as the 'create' handler (described below). |\n| entrypoints.plugin.create | function | This is called after plugin is loaded. 'this' can be used to access                                         UxpPluginInfo object. If 'plugin' object is defined, 'create' must be defined.                                         To signal failure, throw an exception. |\n| entrypoints.plugin.destroy | function | This is called before plugin is unloaded. 'this' can be used to access                                          UxpPluginInfo object. |\n| entrypoints.panels | Array<object> | This contains a list of key-value pairs where each key is a panel id (string) and                               value is the data for the panel whose type can be object/function.
