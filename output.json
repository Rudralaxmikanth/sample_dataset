Menu items are displayed in the                                         same order as specified in this array. For specifying a separator,                                         a value of \"-\" or menu item with label \"-\" can be used at required place in the array. |\n| entrypoints.panels.menuItems.id | string | identifier of the menu item. |\n| entrypoints.panels.menuItems.label | string | display text for the menu item. Should be localized. If label is not                                              specified, id is used as label. |\n| entrypoints.panels.menuItems.enabled | boolean | enabled/disabled state for the menu item. Default - true. |\n| entrypoints.panels.menuItems.checked | boolean | checked state for the menu item.
